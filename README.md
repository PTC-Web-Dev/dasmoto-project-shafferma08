### **Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts**

### **Project Brief**

Welcome to your first off-platform project! For this assignment, you will build a simple, single-page website for a fictional arts and crafts store called Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts. This project is a great opportunity to apply your HTML and CSS skills outside of the Codecademy environment.

The goal is to recreate a provided design specification, just like you would for a client in a real-world web development job. This is a chance to practice **self-directed learning**, so you are encouraged to use online resources, documentation, and the hints provided below to solve problems on your own.

### **Getting Started**

1.  **Accept the assignment** on GitHub Classroom. This will create a repository for you.
2.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine using VS Code.
3.  **Open the project folder** in your preferred text editor. You'll find a basic file structure and the necessary images.
4.  **Start building!** You'll be working with `index.html` and `style.css`.

### **Project Requirements**

To complete this project successfully, your website must include:

* A logical folder structure with separate files for your HTML and CSS.
* An `index.html` file to build the page content.
* A `style.css` file to handle all the styling.
* All four of the provided images: `pattern.jpg`, `hacksaw.jpeg`, `frames.jpeg`, and `finnish.jpeg`.

### **Project Instructions**

Use the website design image and the resources above to guide you through the project.

### **1. Build the Header**

Create the main header section of the page. This includes the large, centered heading for the business name.

### **2. Add the Brushes Section**

Below the header, create the first content section for "Brushes." This section should include the H2 header, the image, and all the associated text and pricing.

### **3. Add the Frames Section**

Create the second content section for "Frames." This section will follow the same pattern as the previous one, with a new H2 header, image, and text.

### **4. Add the Paint Section**

Create the final content section for "Paint." This section should include the H2 header, the image, and all the associated text and pricing.
